            <p class="about-left">Hey there!<br /> So, here's a little bit about me:<br />I have a background in baking, I actually graduated from<br /> Le Cordon Bleu College Of Culinary Arts in Miami in 2012.</p>
            <img class="about-right" id="baker" src="images/ali-baker-about.jpg" alt="Ali Baker" />
            <p class="about-right">I worked in NYC in many bakeries and cake shops, but due to<br /> developing sensitivities and dietary restrictions, I decided to work<br /> on my own menu which soon turned into a pretty cool bakery project!<br /> Hopefully, the bakery should open sometime next year.</p>

            <p class="about-left">In the meantime, I decided to go back to school and enrolled in<br /> <a id="um" href="http://miami.edu">University of Miami</a> to pursue my studies in Fine Arts and Psychology.<br /> My expected graduation date is Summer 2017.</p>
