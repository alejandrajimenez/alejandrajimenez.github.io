            <p class="artwork-info">I have selected some of my most recent work to show you here. As a student, I've had the opportunity to work in multiple design tasks from corporate brandings to magazines and posters. However, my personal style as an artist has evolved and I've been able to identify more as an Illustrator and Cartoonist above all else in the field. Among my many future projects are a series of webcomics and children's books.<br /><strong>Stay tuned!</strong></p>
